# 🔁 Palindrome Number Checker

This Java program checks whether a given integer is a **palindrome** — a number that reads the same backward as forward (e.g., 121, 1331).

## 📋 Features

* Takes an integer input from the user.
* Reverses the number and compares it with the original.
* Prints whether the number is a **Palindrome** or **not**.

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites

* Java installed (JDK 8 or higher)

### Steps

1. Save the code in a file named `Palindrome.java`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
3. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   javac Palindrome.java
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   java Palindrome
   ```

## 💡 Sample Output

```
Enter a number: 121
Number is Palindrome
```

```
Enter a number: 123
Number is not Palindrome
```

## 🧠 Concepts Used

* `while` loop
* Modulus and integer division
* Reversing a number
* Conditional logic
